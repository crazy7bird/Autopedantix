# Autopedantix
This is a bot that play a french game [Pédantix](https://cemantix.certitudes.org/pedantix).

# Environment 
This script is used as tampermokey script (tested under Firefox).

# How to use it.
Best is to show console in your browser, sometime the script seems to do nothing, but he is running.

F1 : start autoplaying the game.
F2 : reload pages, and delet all local contents ( the website use localStorage).
F3 : Show all variables for debug purpose.
F4 : Launch the new page detector (page change every day at noon, F4 as to be launch before, once a new page is ready, it will start the autoplaying mode (like F1)).

# The story behind this script
A collegue show me this game [Pédantix](https://cemantix.certitudes.org/pedantix).
The goal is to find a french wikipedia page by guessing it tille.
The same collegue give me tips, like, when i start i always check words like :
 - le, un, de, qu, c, s, il, on, n, pas, non, mais, ou, et, donc…
As do everyday the same thing, the idiea of a V1, was to put this words for me.
Then i wanted it to play alone.
I started added more functions like :
 - synonims finder.
 - Number finder (actualy not working).
 - Wikipedia shearsh.

After all the messy code i write by discovering how i can optimize the speed of my script, i started a V2, thats was mainly here to clean the code and strat an architecture.

# Conclusion.
Have fun using it and watch this :
